\title{Calculate GATK strand bias}
\usage{
calc_SB_GATK(a, b, e, d)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{Number of reads supporting the reference allele mapping to the forward strand}

\item{b}{Number of reads supporting the alternate allele mapping to the forward strand}

\item{e}{Number of reads supporting the reference allele mapping to the forward strand}

\item{d}{Number of reads supporting the alternate allele mapping to the reverse strand}
}
\value{
Vector containing SB-GATK of each variant, ordered in order of appearance in the vcf file
}
\description{
Calculate variant strand bias as defined by GATK (SB-GATK)
}
\details{
This strand bias value was defined by GATK and described in \emph{The effect of strand bias in Illumina short-read sequencing data}. It can be accessed here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3532123/ Its value ranges from 0 to infinity.
