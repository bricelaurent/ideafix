# IDEAFIX

ideafix is a decision tree-based variant refinement tool that filters formaldehyde-induced cytosine deaminations from variant lists obtained from DNA sequencing data from FFPE specimens.

## Installation

``` r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mmaitenat/ideafix")
```

## Requirements

ideafix needs the following programs to run:

* bcftools

* samtools

ideafix also needs the following files:

* Fasta file of the genome data was aligned to. If data is unaligned, the genome to align the data to.

If variant calling is to be run from bam files, you will also need:

* GATK4

## Example

``` r
library(ideafix)
# Extract descriptors from vcf filename
vcf_filename <- "/home/maitena/Research/FFPE/code/ideafix/ideafix/inst/extdata/SRR1523260_filtermarks_annotated.vcf"
ref_genome <- "/home/maitena/Research/Data/RefGenomes/hg19/ucsc.hg19.fasta"
descriptors <- get_descriptors(vcf_filename = vcf_filename, fasta_filename = ref_genome)
predictions <- filter_variants(variant_descriptors = descriptors)
```
